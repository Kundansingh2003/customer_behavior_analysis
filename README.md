## 📌 Project Overview

## Tools

* **Python**: For data loading, cleaning, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* **SQL**: Used for running queries on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server databases.
* **Power BI**: For building an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
* **Gamma**: Used for creating a professional presentation of the findings.
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy (for Python), among others.

## Steps

1. **Load the Dataset**:

   * The dataset is loaded into Python using pandas and appropriate connectors for SQL-based sources.
2. **Perform EDA**:

   * Exploratory data analysis is done to understand the structure of the data and its initial insights. This includes basic statistics, missing data analysis, and feature distribution analysis.
3. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.
   * Apply data transformation techniques such as normalization or encoding as needed.
4. **Run SQL Queries**:

   * Execute queries to manipulate and filter the data stored in PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server to extract meaningful insights.
5. **Build Power BI Dashboard**:

   * A Power BI dashboard is created to visualize key metrics and trends in the dataset using interactive elements (charts, tables, and KPIs).
6. **Create Report**:

   * A report summarizing the findings and insights is generated in a structured format.
7. **Presentation in Gamma**:

   * A professional PowerPoint presentation is created using Gamma to showcase key findings and data visualizations.

## Results

* **Key Insights**: Summarize the major findings from the data, such as trends, correlations, and predictions.
* **Visualizations**: Share screenshots or descriptions of the key visualizations used in the Power BI dashboard and report.
